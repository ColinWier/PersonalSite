	<h1>Personal Site of Colin W.</h1>
	<p>Well after doing this for a second time this is basically childs play.</p>
	<ol>
	<li>Why do I have to make an all new one.</li>
	<li>I've made some mediocre websites at best this is just the most basic of basic.</li>
	</ol>
	<ul>
	<li> I don't know what else to say besides random stuff to fill the page.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Anyways I graduate in like a month, its great and absolutly <em>horrifying</em> great because I dont have to go to highschool anymore. Horrifying because I means now that I have to become a working and living <strong>adult</strong>. Maybe I'll win $1 billion and I can just live off of that for a couple of years	people who won the lottery never have bad experiences or end up bankrupt <em><strong>right</strong></em>. I dont know I am just typing the first thing that comes to my mind.</p>
	<h2>Oh crap this is nothing like the paper</h2>
	<p>Oh well I made the paper in a sleep deprived state I barely remember writing whats on the paper.</p>
